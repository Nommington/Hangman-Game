# Star Trek: The Next Generation Hangman
## Guess the name of the Enterprise crew member!
>TNG Hangman is a simple application created using HTML/CSS and Vanilla Javascript, with styling and sound effects to make you feel like you're on the bridge of the Enterprise. Use letter keys to guess the name of the crew member, but watch your **hull integrity**. If it reaches zero you will experience a **WARP CORE BREACH** and it's **GAME OVER**!
